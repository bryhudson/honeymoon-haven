        question: "Before we had high-speed internet and hot tubs, we had legends. Which famous couple ran the General Store and Gas Dock right here on our property?",
        options: ["Monty & Mary", "Frank & Alice", "The Davidsons", "The Petersons"],
        correctAnswer: "Monty & Mary",
        fact: "Long before this was a private resort, it was the social HQ of the South Shore. Monty and Mary ran the show. If you needed boat fuel, a litre of milk, or the latest scandal from town, you didn't drive to Lake Cowichan - you just walked to the driveway."

        options: ["The South Shore Resort", "Honeymoon Bay Campground", "Cowichan Lake RV Park", "The Loggers' Retreat"],
        correctAnswer: "The South Shore Resort",
        fact: "For over 30 years, our land was the 'South Shore Resort.' It was a bustling summer village where families held onto their lease spots like gold dust. It wasn't just a campground; it was a tight-knit community where the only thing harder than getting a spot was leaving it."
