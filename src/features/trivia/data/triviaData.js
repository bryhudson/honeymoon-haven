        question: "Before we had high-speed internet and hot tubs, we had legends. Which famous couple ran the General Store and Gas Dock right here on our property?",
        options: ["Monty & Mary", "Frank & Alice", "The Davidsons", "The Petersons"],
        correctAnswer: "Monty & Mary",
        fact: "Long before this was a private resort, it was the social HQ of the South Shore. Monty and Mary ran the show. If you needed boat fuel, a litre of milk, or the latest scandal from town, you didn't drive to Lake Cowichan—you just walked to the driveway."

    {
        question: "Before 2015 transformed this land into Honeymoon Haven Resort, what was the official name of the RV park that occupied our grounds?",
        options: ["The South Shore Resort", "Honeymoon Bay Campground", "Cowichan Lake RV Park", "The Loggers' Retreat"],
        correctAnswer: "The South Shore Resort",
        fact: "For over 30 years, our land was the 'South Shore Resort.' It was a bustling summer village where families held onto their lease spots like gold dust. It wasn't just a campground; it was a tight-knit community where the only thing harder than getting a spot was leaving it."

    {
        question: "Forget ski boats—what specific type of industrial beast used to fuel up at the old gas dock on our waterfront?",
        options: ["Boom Boats (Logging Tugs)", "Float Planes", "Coal Barges", "Fishing Trawlers"],
        correctAnswer: "Boom Boats (Logging Tugs)",
        fact: "Our peaceful waterfront used to be a lot louder! The original gas dock was a pit stop for 'Boom Boats'—rugged little tugs that shoved massive raw logs around for the WFI mill. If you think the wake boats are loud today, imagine a diesel tug idling off your deck at 6 AM."

    {
        question: "What specific inventory item made Monty’s Store (at the front of our lot) the most important building in the world to local kids?",
        options: ["Penny Candy", "Slushies", "Comic Books", "Firecrackers"],
        correctAnswer: "Penny Candy",
        fact: "For a generation of summer kids, the walk to 'the front of the property' was a daily pilgrimage. Monty’s wasn't just a store; it was a treasure chest of penny candy. If you had a quarter in the 1980s, you were living like royalty right here at 10257."

    {
        question: "We might own the cabins now, but who was the very first pioneer to clear this land with nothing but horses and oxen in 1887?",
        options: ["Henry March", "Robert Dunsmuir", "Charles Youbou", "Captain Vancouver"],
        correctAnswer: "Henry March",
        fact: "Henry March was the original 'developer' of the South Shore. He turned dense rainforest into the March Farm by hand. Every time you enjoy the open space around our resort or the golf course, you can thank Henry and his oxen for doing the heavy lifting 140 years ago."

    {
        question: "Unlike a standard subdivision where everyone hides behind fences, Honeymoon Haven is legally divided into exactly how many 'shares'?",
        options: ["12 Shares", "24 Shares", "10 Shares", "50 Shares"],
        correctAnswer: "12 Shares",
        fact: "We are a 'Shared Interest' corporation, which is a fancy way of saying we are a team. There are exactly 12 shares for 12 owners. It’s a unique model designed to keep the spirit of the old resort alive—small, exclusive, and connected."

    {
        question: "When our neighbor, March Meadows Golf Club, opened in 1970, what highly sophisticated tool did Charlie March use to cut the ribbon?",
        options: ["Rusty Garden Shears", "A Gold-Plated Sword", "A Chainsaw", "A Pocket Knife"],
        correctAnswer: "Rusty Garden Shears",
        fact: "It wasn't a black-tie affair. True to his farming roots, Charlie March didn't bother with those giant ceremonial scissors. He grabbed a pair of rusty garden shears from the shed to officially open the course. That’s the kind of practical, no-nonsense history we love."

    {
        question: "Which future LPGA millionaire spent her teenage years mowing the grass just a 2-minute walk from our gate?",
        options: ["Dawn Coe-Jones", "Brooke Henderson", "Lorie Kane", "Annika Sorenstam"],
        correctAnswer: "Dawn Coe-Jones",
        fact: "Before she was a Canadian Golf Hall of Famer, Dawn Coe-Jones was just the kid next door. Her summer job was driving an old Ford tractor at March Meadows. It’s proof that you can go from Honeymoon Bay to the world stage (but you'll probably miss the lake)."

    {
        question: "Why do we pity the people in Youbou during a July heatwave while we sit comfortably on our decks?",
        options: ["We’re on the 'Shady Side'", "We have better AC", "They have more mosquitos", "The wind hits them harder"],
        correctAnswer: "We’re on the 'Shady Side'",
        fact: "It’s not just luck; it’s geography. The mountains behind us block the blazing afternoon sun, giving us the famous 'Shady Side' advantage. While the North Shore is baking at 6 PM, we’re chilling in nature’s air conditioning."
    },
    {
        question: "Who are the 800-pound 'locals' that frequently wander through our resort and treat our lawns like an all-you-can-eat salad bar?",
        options: ["Roosevelt Elk", "Black Bears", "Cougars", "Moose"],
        correctAnswer: "Roosevelt Elk",
        fact: "We might pay the taxes, but the Elk run the town. Honeymoon Bay’s famous Roosevelt Elk herd has been wandering through this property since before Henry March arrived. If they decide to nap on your lawn, you don't argue—you just take pictures (from a safe distance!)."
