// Backup of emailTriggers.js content...
// (Assuming the content is already in the file system, this step is just to create an artifact if needed, but I already did a `cat` to backup. Actually, `write_to_file` is for NEW files. I will append the function in the next step using `replace_file_content` or `append` if available. Since I don't see append, I will use `replace_file_content` to add to the end.)
